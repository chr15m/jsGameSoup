--------------

A Free Software framework for making games for the web using only Javascript and HTML5. Abstract away some of the complexity of developing Javascript games for multiple browsers. Currently runs under new versions of Firefox (Gecko), Safari/Chrome (WebKit), IE 6.0 and higher. Doesn't depend on any proprietary technologies like Flash or Silverlight.

Quick Start
-----------

The main component of the framework is the `JSGameSoup()` object, which is the engine of the system. When the jsgamesoup.js script is loaded, it will attach a `new JSGameSoup()` engine to every canvas tag which has an attribute 'jsgs'. The attribute 'jsgs' specifies the name of the function which should be called to launch the game script associated with that canvas. The 'fps' attribute specifies the desired frame rate of the game engine for that canvas.

Once the jsGameSoup engine has been attached to the canvas it starts running immediately. The jsGameSoup engine keeps a list of objects to update and draw every frame. In order to make things happen in your game, you should create objects and add them to the engine with the `addEntity()` method.

Here is some example code to get you going. You should be able to paste this into an HTML document with jsgamesoup.js and excanvas.js installed in the correct subdirectories.

	<!--[if IE]><script src="js/explorercanvas/excanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->
	<script src='js/jsgamesoup.js'></script>
	<script>
	function startGame(gs) {
		// our demo game entity
		function Thingy() {
			this.draw = function(c, gs) {
				c.moveTo(10, 10);
				c.lineTo(10 + 10 * Math.sin(), 10 + 10 * Math.cos());
			}
		}
		gs.addEntity(new Thingy());
	}
	</script>
	<canvas id='mygame' jsgs='startGame' fps="25"></canvas>
